# NUM ITEMS PER PACKAGE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the maximum number of items that will be directly
# selected for a package.  If there are references from these
# items such as links, folder contents, and reference attributes,
# those indirectly selected items are not bound to this limit.
#
# If there are no references, each package will contain exactly
# this number of items except the last since there might not
# be enough items left to fill the full package.  It will instead
# contain 1 - n, where n is the number entered below.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# MASTER LOG FILE FOLDER
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Absolute path to the directory that the Master Export
# Package File (Summary File) and Master Tracking File
# will be written to.  
#
# This should be on a different disk than that specified
# for the individual packages since those disks can run
# out of disk space.  There must always be sufficient
# disk space to write to this location.  The tools does
# have recovery mechanisms if this location does run out
# of disk space.  If absolutely necessary to combine
# with the package data storage locations, use the last
# possible location to ensure that it runs out of space
# at the same time as the package data.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# STORAGE LOCATIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Comma-delimited list of absolute paths to volumes / 
# storage locations that the individual package data will be 
# written.  The tool start with the first storage location and
# continues onto the next when it runs out of disk space.
#
# Each storage location should be on different disks such that
# when one runs out of space that another was not filled since
# it was on the same disk.
#
# Ideally, these should be on different disks than the MASTER
# LOG FILE FOLDER.  
#
# Individual package subdirectories can be moved among any 
# volume / storage location (new or existing) in a subdirectory
# named "masterFolder" when the tool is not running.  When the
# tools restart, they will recognize the package folders among
# any of these locations.

# DATA MODEL SUPPORT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# If you can guarantee that some aspects of the DB2 Content
# Manager data model are not used for your model or at least the
# items that you are going to export, you can save significant
# time by allowing the tool to optimize based on your data model.
# 
# The tool can optimize based on your YES or NO choices to the 
# following features:
#        - Children / Multi-Value Attributes
#        - Links (Inbound or Outbound)
#        - Folders with Content in them
#        - Resource Items with Stored Resource Content
#        - Documents with Parts with Stored Resource Content
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

Data Model Supports Children=NO
Data Model Supports Links=NO
Data Model Supports Folders With Contents=NO
Data Model Supports Resource Items With Contents=NO
Data Model Supports Document Parts With Contents=YES

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# PERFORMANCE BOOST IF NO INDIRECT SELECTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# When an item selected for export has references to other items,
# the tool supports automatically selecting these items and any
# items they in turn reference.  Additionally, if other versions
# exist any version not directly selected can also be
# automatically selected by the system.
#
# If your data model hass no links, no folder contents, and
# no reference attribute groups, and no versioning, or if you
# want all of these reference relationships dropped and only
# export the versions meeting the original selection criteria,
# you can give a significant peformance boost to the export
# process.
#
# If you meet these criteria, set the following settings
# found in the "Export Package" configuration section below.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Refer to Section: TExportPackageICM.ExportOptions
# Use Setting:  FolderContentPolicy=OPTION_FOLDER_CONTENT_REMOVE_VALUE
# Use Setting:  LinkedItemsPolicy=OPTION_LINKED_ITEMS_REMOVE_LINK

# NUMBER OF RETRY ATTEMPTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Number of retry attempts per issue per level of recovery.
# In Export Manager, there are three levels at which the tool
# can attempt to recover from an error:
#     1 - Master Level  : Backs out to reconnect.

# wait for a configurable period of time.  The delays
# are enforced at this numbered retry attempt.

# ADVANCED RETRIEVE OPTIMIZATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# The Export Manager is configured to assume absolute

# =================================================================
# Completion Marker
# =================================================================
# The Completion Marker tool works with Import Manager and Export
# Manager to mark items as complete in the original system during
# or after the import process.  This tool takes a partial or
# complete Imported Item Mapping Record output by the Import
# Manager and marks items by modifying an attribute or reindexing
# the item.
#
# For an overview and more information on Completion Marker other
# than configuration options detailed below, refer to the header
# documentation in the TExportManagerICM.java and
# TImportManagerCompletionMarkerICM.java sample files.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------


# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# MARKERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The Completion Marker tool has several "markers" available
# that can be used to mark an item as complete in the original
# system.  A different marker can be defined for each item type.
#
# Marker Choices:
#     - Replace an Existing Attribute Value
#     - Add a Prefix to an Existing Attribute Value
#     - Add a Suffix to an Existing Attribute Value
#     - Reindex the item, changing its item type.
# 
# Defining Markers:
#   Define a marker for each item type of items to be marked
#   as complete by adding one line according to the designated
#   format for the type of marker desired.  If you have items
#   completed for 5 different item types, you will need 5
#   markers, one line for each of the 5 item types.
#
#   Follow the format designated for each marker type below.
#
#   ATTRIBUTE REPLACEMENT
#     This marker replaces any existing value for the
#     specified fixed or variable-length String, Integer,
#     or Short attribute with the specified String, Integer,
#     or Short value.
#
#     Marker Definition String:
#         Mark by Attribute Replacement=<Item Type Name>::<Attribute Name>=(String|Integer|Short)<Attribute Value>
#
#     Example:
#         Mark by Attribute Replacement=myItemType1::migrated=(String)true
#
#   ATTRIBUTE PREFIX
#     This marker adds the specified prefix to the beginning
#     of any existing value of the specified fixed or
#     variable-length String attribute.  If there is no
#     existing value, the prefix will be added as the entire
#     value.
#
#     Marker Definition String:
#         Mark by Attribute Prefix=<Item Type Name>::<Attribute Name>+=<Prefix>
#
#     Example:
#         Mark by Attribute Prefix=myItemType2::customerId+=migrated
#
#   ATTRIBUTE SUFFIX
#     This marker adds the specified suffix to the end
#     of any existing value of the specified fixed or
#     variable-length String attribute.  If there is no
#     existing value, the suffix will be added as the entire
#     value.
#
#     Marker Definition String:
#         Mark by Attribute Suffix=<Item Type Name>::<Attribute Name>=+<Suffix>
#
#     Example:
#         Mark by Attribute Suffix=myItemType3::customerId=+migrated
#
#   ITEM TYPE REINDEX
#     This marker changes the item type of all completed 
#     items of the specified item type to the specified
#     new item type.  This marker only supports flat
#     models (no child components).
#
#     Marker Definition String:
#         Mark by Item Type Reindex=<Original Item Type Name>-><New Item Type Name>
#
#     Example:
#         Mark by Item Type Reindex=myItemType4->migratedItemType
#     
# Restarting Tool & Remarking:
#   Any marker will only be applied once to a completed item,
#   regardless of how many times the tool is run.  The same
#   item can be marked more than once if a different marker
#   is specified (or existing marker is changed) for an item
#   type.
#  
#   Therefore if you wish to mark your items in more than one
#   way, run the tool twice, but change the markers between
#   each run.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

Mark by Attribute Replacement=myItemType1::migrated=(String)true
Mark by Attribute Prefix=myItemType2::customerId+=migrated
Mark by Attribute Suffix=myItemType3::customerId=+migrated
Mark by Item Type Reindex=myItemType4->migratedItemType

# MASTER LOG FILE FOLDER
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Absolute path to the directory that the Master Package File and 
# Master Imported Item Mapping Record is located.
#
# This should be on a different disk than that which was
# used to store individual package data since those disks are
# likely to be low on available space due to being filled up by
# package data.
#
# There must always be sufficient disk space to write to this
# location.  The tools does have recovery mechanisms if this
# location does run out of disk space, but the safest solution
# is to ensure that there is enough space before you start.

# NUMBER OF RETRY ATTEMPTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Number of retry attempts per issue per level of recovery.
# With Reconciler, there are two levels at which the tool
# can attempt to recover from an error:
#     1 - Connect Level  : Backs out to reconnect.
#     2 - Query Level    : Reissues query resuming where left off.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# DELAY AT RETRY NUMBER
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# The tool can immediately attempt to recover, but after a 
# number of attempts, it migth be best to have the tool 
# wait for a configurable period of time.  The delays
# are enforced at this numbered retry attempt.
#
# This can be disabled by setting to a higher number than
# the maximum number of allowed attempts.  This can
# be always enabled by setting to 0.

# DELAY TIME
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# When delays take effect according to the DELAY AT RETRY
# NUMBER setting (above), this determines the amount of
# time in milliseconds (ms) that the tool will pause.

# Export Package
# =================================================================
# Configure package and item-level Import / Export settings for
# TExportPackageICM-based tools & API.  The TImportExportICM.ini
# configuration file is the default configuration file used by
# tools that are based on the TExportPackageICM sample API, such as
# TExportManagerICM, TImportManagerICM, TExportICM, and TImportICM.
#
# Settings for direct TExportPackageICM sample API users may be
# modified throught the Options objects API or saved and loaded
# from configuration files.  Direct API defaults (compared to tools
# that use the sample API) are set by the default constructor, not
# the configuration file by default.  Configuration files may be
# modified externally.
#
# SYNTAX:  The syntax settings in this section follows sample API
#          usage for setting name and constant options identical
#          to that in the TExportPackageICM.Options,
#          ImportOptions, and ExportOptions interfaces.  See
#          interface Javadoc for complete option listings.  For
#          example, setAbcdePolicy(FGHIJK) would be listed as an
#          individual line “Abcde=FGHIJK”.  Only one entry per
#          line is allowed, each of which must be separated by an
#          equals sign.  Only need to specify desired setting in
#          no particular order.  Comment lines denoted by initial
#          character ‘#’.  All lines that do not begin with a
#          comment that do not begin with a known setting will be
#          ignored.
#
# For more information on the single-batch Import / Export Tools
# & API, refer to the TExportPackageICM.doc sample file.  For
# an overview for how all sample import / export tools fit
# together, refer to online support document #1161938.
